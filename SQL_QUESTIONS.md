Question 11 Compare each player's performance across different cricket formats. For players who have played at least 2 different formats, show their total runs in Test cricket, ODI cricket, and T20I cricket, along with their overall batting average across all formats.
Question 12 Analyze each international team's performance when playing at home versus playing away. Determine whether each team played at home or away based on whether the venue country matches the team's country. Count wins for each team in both home and away conditions.

Question 14 Examine bowling performance at different venues. For bowlers who have played at least 3 matches at the same venue, calculate their average economy rate, total wickets taken, and number of matches played at each venue. Focus on bowlers who bowled at least 4 overs in each match.
Question 15 Identify players who perform exceptionally well in close matches. A close match is defined as one decided by less than 50 runs OR less than 5 wickets. For these close matches, calculate each player's average runs scored, total close matches played, and how many of those close matches their team won when they batted.
Question 16 Track how players' batting performance changes over different years. For matches since 2020, show each player's average runs per match and average strike rate for each year. Only include players who played at least 5 matches in that year.
Advanced Level (Questions 17-25)
Question 17 Investigate whether winning the toss gives teams an advantage in winning matches. Calculate what percentage of matches are won by the team that wins the toss, broken down by their toss decision (choosing to bat first or bowl first).
Question 18 Find the most economical bowlers in limited-overs cricket (ODI and T20 formats). Calculate each bowler's overall economy rate and total wickets taken. Only consider bowlers who have bowled in at least 10 matches and bowled at least 2 overs per match on average.
Question 19 Determine which batsmen are most consistent in their scoring. Calculate the average runs scored and the standard deviation of runs for each player. Only include players who have faced at least 10 balls per innings and played since 2022. A lower standard deviation indicates more consistent performance.
Question 20 Analyze how many matches each player has played in different cricket formats and their batting average in each format. Show the count of Test matches, ODI matches, and T20 matches for each player, along with their respective batting averages. Only include players who have played at least 20 total matches across all formats.
Question 21 Create a comprehensive performance ranking system for players. Combine their batting performance (runs scored, batting average, strike rate), bowling performance (wickets taken, bowling average, economy rate), and fielding performance (catches, stumpings) into a single weighted score. Use this formula and rank players:
Batting points: (runs_scored × 0.01) + (batting_average × 0.5) + (strike_rate × 0.3)
Bowling points: (wickets_taken × 2) + (50 - bowling_average) × 0.5) + ((6 - economy_rate) × 2)

Rank the top performers in each cricket format.
Question 22 Build a head-to-head match prediction analysis between teams. For each pair of teams that have played at least 5 matches against each other in the last 3 years, calculate:
Total matches played between them
Wins for each team
Average victory margin when each team wins
Performance when batting first vs bowling first at different venues
Overall win percentage for each team in this head-to-head record
Question 23 Analyze recent player form and momentum. For each player's last 10 batting performances, calculate:
Average runs in their last 5 matches vs their last 10 matches
Recent strike rate trends
Number of scores above 50 in recent matches
A consistency score based on standard deviation
Based on these metrics, categorize players as being in "Excellent Form", "Good Form", "Average Form", or "Poor Form".
Question 24 Study successful batting partnerships to identify the best player combinations. For pairs of players who have batted together as consecutive batsmen (positions differ by 1) in at least 5 partnerships:
Calculate their average partnership runs
Count how many of their partnerships exceeded 50 runs
Find their highest partnership score
Calculate their success rate (percentage of good partnerships)
Rank the most successful batting partnerships.
Question 25 Perform a time-series analysis of player performance evolution. Track how each player's batting performance changes over time by:
Calculating quarterly averages for runs and strike rate
Comparing each quarter's performance to the previous quarter
Identifying whether performance is improving, declining, or stable
Determining overall career trajectory over the last few years
Categorizing players' career phase as "Career Ascending", "Career Declining", or "Career Stable"
Only analyze players with data spanning at least 6 quarters and a minimum of 3 matches per quarter.
